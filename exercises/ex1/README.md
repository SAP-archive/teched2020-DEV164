# Exercise 1 - Project Setup using SAP Business Application Studio

In this exercise, you will create a new UI5 application based on a provided template of SAP Business Application Studio.

## Scenario

Recently those have been upgraded with new sensors with internet connection, so that their measuring values are available as a service. To make use of this data and to improve their internal workflows the company asked us to provide an application leveraging this sensor data, visualize it and provide an overview of the current state of each sensor, so that they can react quickly on any issues.
