# DEV164 - Developing Apps with SAPUI5

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called **DEV164 â€“ Developing Apps with SAPUI5**.

## Overview

In this session, you will learn about developing web applications with SAPUI5. We will use the SAP Business Application Studio as development environment and build a small application to get familiar with our latest developer tools and recommendations.

## Requirements

The requirements to follow the exercises in this repository are:
- Get a free trial account on SAP Cloud Platform; see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/hcp-create-trial-account.html).
- Enable Cloud Foundry and create an organization e.g. *ui5-cloud-foundry*; see the [help portal](https://help.sap.com/viewer/a96b1df8525f41f79484717368e30626/Cloud/en-US/dc18bac42270468d84b6c030a668e003.html).
- Set Up SAP Business Application Studio for development; see this [tutorial](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-onboarding.html).
- Be excited about the power of SAP technologies to make your developer life easier.
